This document gives a (rough) overview of WildFly, a Java EE application server. This document may serve as an introduction to application servers in Java EE.

== Application servers
Java EE defines a https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/tech/index.html[set] of specifications, known as Java Specification Requests (JSR). Application servers have to implement [small]#(parts of)# these standards in order to be compliant with [small]#(a subset of)# Java EE. An important standard among those is the Servlet API, or https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=369[JSR 369].

A Java EE application server is a piece of software that ease the development of web applications, by providing services to the Java web developer. Your application server provides containers in which you, the web developer, embed your code. The container calls your code whenever adequate. For example, we use the web container in the https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Servlets.adoc[Servlets] document.

Examples of Java EE compliant application servers: GlassFish (Oracle, open source, reference implementation of Java EE), WildFly (Red Hat / JBoss, open source), WebSphere AS (IBM)â€¦

== Running WildFly
* Download and install a local copy of WildFly (see https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Tools.adoc[Tools]).
* The server is commanded thanks to the commands in the `bin` subfolder, to be run in a terminal.
* Start the server with `standalone.sh` (we will use only the standalone mode).
* The command line interface (CLI) to the server is invoked with `jboss-cli.sh`. After invoking this command, connect to your server (the tool tells you how to do this), then type `help --commands` and find out how to shut it down.

== Embedded database
Any compliant Java EE server comes with an embedded SQL database management system, that will be used as a default for deployed applications if none other is configured.

* Restart you server, connect to it with the CLI, type `/subsystem=datasources/:read-children-names(child-type=data-source)` to list the configured data sources. What is the name of the default data source?

== Manipulating the server
Supplementary to the somewhat austere CLI, it is possible to configure many aspects of the server using its graphical administration console.

Browse to http://localhost:8080/ to reach the server, then `Administration Console`. Follow the instructions to create a user. You can then access the Administration console. Look at the properties of the data-source whose name you have found previously (into `Configuration`, subsytem `Datasource & Drivers`).

== Deploying applications
The `standalone/deployments` directory is used to deploy your application, once it is packaged appropriately (e.g. as a WAR file). Simply drop the file there. WildFly will then create a file in the same folder to tell you whether the application was deployed successfully. (Check the https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/blob/master/Servlets.adoc[Servlets] document to learn how to create an adequate file.)

== Technical tips
=== Enable assertions
Add `JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -ea"` at the appropriate place in `bin/standalone.conf` (after the first line that defines `JAVA_OPTS`) to enable Java assertions (http://docs.wildfly.org/13/Admin_Guide.html#JVM_settings[doc]{emptyattribute}).
