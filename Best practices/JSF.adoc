== Multiple field validation
Sometimes the validation logic requires knowledge of the value of multiple fields. (Example: required `start` ≤ `end`, where `start` and `end` are two request parameters.) In such case I consider the usual JSF validation approach (namely, by treating the problem in the JSF validation phase) inelegant, because it is designed for single-field validation. I prefer to use case-based navigation in the action phase. Some may disagree, see e.g. BalusC, “JSF ajax/action/listener methods are semantically the wrong place to do validation” http://stackoverflow.com/a/5897183/859604[here] and an alternative proposal http://balusc.omnifaces.org/2007/12/validator-for-multiple-fields.html[here].
