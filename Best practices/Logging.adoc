= Logging best practices

[[logging-choice]]
== Framework
One of the PITA in Java world is the multiplicity of logging framework (see Antonio Goncalvesâ€™ related https://antoniogoncalves.org/2012/09/06/i-need-you-for-logging-api-spec-lead/[blog post]). My personal default choice is to go for JUL for Java EE projects and SLF4J plus logback for Java SE projects.
