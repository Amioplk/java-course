= Maven best practices

== Naming conventions

Summary:

* As Maven `groupId`, use a domain name you control and invert it (example: `io.github.oliviercailloux`), to make sure it is unique
* As Maven `artifactId`, use your project name, with spaces replaced by hyphens (example: `my-project-name`)
* In Maven identifiers, avoid Java keywords and “words” starting with a digit
* As Java base package name, use your Maven coordinates, to ensure uniqueness, with hyphens replaced by underscores (example: `io.github.oliviercailloux.my_project_name`)

Details:

* Maven coordinate identifiers (`groupId` and `artifactId`) should contain lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens only (https://maven.apache.org/maven-conventions.html[source]).
* To make sure they are unique, use a domain name you control as a `groupId`, and invert it (https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html[source]).
* Java conventions suggest to ensure uniqueness of your package names using the same rule (source: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html[tutorial], or see the non-normative note “Package names” in the http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-6.html#jls-6.1[specs]).
* Thus, I suggest naming your packages according to your `groupId` followed by a dot followed by your `artifactId`.
* Hyphens are not allowed in package names, but underscores are (package names consist in dot-separated identifiers, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-7.html#jls-7.4.1[JLS 7.4.1]; identifiers consist in a `JavaLetter` then a set of `JavaLetterOrDigit`, a `JavaLetter` being a character for which `Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(int)` returns `true`, see http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-3.html#jls-Identifier[JLS Identifiers]; this includes the ASCII underscore (known as LOW LINE in Unicode, U+005F) but not the hyphen, see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/lang/Character.html#isJavaIdentifierStart-int-[Character], http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Pc/list.htm[Unicode], http://stackoverflow.com/a/32065830[SO]).
* Thus, I suggest to transform hyphens used in `artifactId` into underscores when converting to package name. (Applying the conventional strategy for transforming domain names into valid Java identifiers.)
* In Maven identifiers, avoid Java keywords and “words” starting with a digit: they are legal in Maven but not convertible to Java identifiers.

== Encoding
Include the property `<project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>` in your POM to ensure platform-independent behavior (and get rid of the warning Maven prints otherwise).

== Java version
Include properties: `<maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>` (or adjust to the desired java version) to indicate which java version you develop in (and for). This is https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/compile-mojo.html[officially supported] and is thus to be preferred to the more verbose explicit https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/examples/set-compiler-source-and-target.html[configuration] of the `maven-compiler-plugin`.

== Do not require web descriptor
Web applications do not require a web descriptor (the `web.xml` file that goes in the `WEB-INF` folder). Maven however required it by default when asked to package a war file. If you do not need a web descriptor, make your project as clean as possible and do not include one! Rather, include the property `<failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>` in your `pom.xml`.

* [Note 1: As of Release 3.0.0 of the Apache Maven WAR Plugin, this is no more necessary: “The default value for failOnMissingWebXml has been changed from true to false.” (https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/index.html[source]). However including the property anyway improves your project compatibility. See also http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/plugins/trunk/maven-war-plugin/src/main/java/org/apache/maven/plugins/war/WarMojo.java?view=log[source code history], http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/plugins/tags/[releases].] 
* [Note 2: Web applications do not require a web descriptor any more since Servlet 2.5 MR 5, more than 10 years ago (see JSR 340 Servlet 3.1 http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/servlet-3_1-fr-eval-spec/servlet-3_1-final.pdf[spec], A.7.6 and 10.13).]
