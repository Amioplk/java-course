= Log

Logging is tracing what your program is doing with statements that indicate which instructions have been executed and the values of important variables.

One of the exasperating things in the Java world is the multiplicity of logging framework (see Antonio Goncalvesâ€™ related https://antoniogoncalves.org/2012/09/06/i-need-you-for-logging-api-spec-lead/[blog post]). My personal default choice is to go for JUL for Java EE projects and SLF4J plus logback for Java SE projects.

See https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/raw/master/Log/SLF4J/presentation.pdf[presentation] about SLF4J.

== Reason for logging frameworks
It is classical to use `System.out.println` to log. (In an application server, the container will by default redirect the output to the log file; otherwise, the result is simply shown in the terminal.) 

However, this is not the cleanest way to log:

* it is not configurable
* it does not offer differentiated log levels
* if you later move the code to a standalone library or application, you will have to refactor all those statements to turn them into proper log statements

== Java Utils Logging

To log using Java Utils Logging (JUL), proceed as follows. First, declare a logger in your class using this code.

----
@SuppressWarnings("unused")
private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(MyClassName.class.getCanonicalName());
----

You can then write logging statements such as `LOGGER.info("Hello, world.");`.

(The suppress warnings is there to make sure the compiler will not nag you if it turns out you do not use the logger anywhere.)
