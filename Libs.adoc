= Libs

My recommendations concerning various libraries.

* Google https://github.com/google/guava[Guava]: “new collection types (such as multimap and multiset), immutable collections, a graph library, functional types, an in-memory cache, and APIs/utilities for concurrency, I/O, hashing, primitives, reflection, string processing, and much more”. You should definitely use their preconditions helpers. Then check whatever else you might have a use for.

* Parse command line arguments: I have used Apache http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/[Commons CLI], but I’d encourage you to check out http://pholser.github.io/jopt-simple/[JOpt Simple].
