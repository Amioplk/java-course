The entry page of the course about Java in L3.

== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics and the basic (non object-oriented) programming concepts in Java. If you have followed an algorithmics course with illustrations and exercices in Java, you satisfy the prerequisites.

== Abbreviations

* [SK]: Supposedly Known
* [I]: Important
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* [M]: Mandatory exercices
* ESx.y(.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.

== Instructions & grading

* Your GitHub username and git “User Name” must be identical.

=== Book exercices
* Create a personal repository named `Java-L3-Eck-Ex`. You deposit the book exercices (EE) there. All related classes must be prefixed with `EExx`, for example `EE34MyClass`. You are free to choose the folder structure.
* All mandatory (suffixed with [M]) book exercices (prefixed with EE) must be in that repository (in the branch `master`), 3 days before the lecture, 23:59 + 1min (e.g., lecture Saturday 23rd means a deadline on the end of Wednesday 20th).
* For the book exercices, you receive either 1 (exercices are done on time, even imperfectly, committed under your name) or 0 (exercices are not done on time). This counts for 10% of the CC grade. (Once graded, you can remove the book exercices from your repository, or leave them there.)

=== Project
* Descriptions are https://github.com/oliviercailloux/projets/tree/master/SE[here].
* Create a public group repository (once for the group). It must have _exactly_ the name given in the title of your project description, except using - instead of spaces: do not change case, add spaces, use \_ instead of -, … Please do _not_ send me an e-mail to tell me your project url: I’ll find it; and do not add me to your project.
** For unique complete class names, use as basis the package `io.github.oliviercailloux.y2018` suffixed with your project name (converted to a package name) and possibly suffixed with whatever you want to organize the code as desired (for example, `io.github.oliviercailloux.y2018.our_great_project.utils`).
* For each functionality: open a new Issue on GitHub, named exactly according to the functionality. Do not rename the issue (only the original name counts).
** For a new issue about an existing functionality (continuing the implementation): open a new Issue whose name is the name of the functionality with a hyphen and a number, starting with 2. For example, Contract1-2 for continuing the functionality Contract1. (Then, Contract1-3, and so on.)
* https://help.github.com/articles/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users/[Assign] the persons who worked on the issue so that they are visible in GitHub. Must be one or two persons (you are encouraged to use pair-programming). Close the issue.
* You will be graded for the functionalities which are _done_ (as defined below). Those grades count for the CC grade. You can modify the code afterwards for a better Project grade.
** An issue is _freezed_ at the earliest time such that one or two persons are assigned on it, it is closed, and the issue has not changed for 3 minutes (the delay permits to assign the correct persons before I consider this specific issue freezed, in case you closed before assigning).
** A functionality is _done_ if, and only if, there exists a _freezed_ issue whose original name is the name of the functionality. The persons assigned to it are those assigned at the freeze time, and may not be changed afterwards.
* If you are late by less than 24h, your grade is halved. If you are more than 24h late, you get 0.

Abreviations for corrections are as follows.

Don’t hesitate to send me your question by e-mail if you’re blocked in your project, instead of wasting hours. However, I do expect that you make some research before you ask, and that your question be clear. See these https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/[guidelines].

* If you work several times on the same aspect of a functionality (and get it wrong the first times), you might get more difficulty points achieved in total than initially planned for that functionality.
* You should each total 6 points of difficulty (the target difficulty) by the end of the year (6 hours work per project inter-session, 9 project inter-sessions, 9 hours per point of difficulty).
* You will receive a Regularity grade at the end of the year, taking into account your total difficulty achieved (the grade adjusts approximately linearly), with a bonus if the work density leans towards the early sessions (reduced penalty) and a malus if it leans towards the late sessions (for about three points). The “middle” date is the midpoint between 10th of April and last session.
* You will receive a Quality grade at the end of the year: a sum, weighted by achieved difficulty, of your quality marks obtained during the year, considering only the best grades if you go beyond 6 points of difficulty.
* Your CC-Project grade is the minimum of the Regularity grade and the Quality grade.

=== General
* The final grade is a mix of 50% CC grade, 50% (final) Project grade.
* The CC grade is composed of 50% CC-Project grade, 20% EE grade (with compensation) and 30% MCQ grade.

== Take notes
* 5 ways of taking notes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AffuwyJZTQQ[video]
* http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/6/1159[Research] shows that taking notes, and especially writing what is said in your own words after some mental processing, permits more effective study

//interfaces with generics and collections
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c10/exercises.html[EE10.4] (except you use the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html[Predicate] interface from the Java API instead of writing your own)

*Exercices*

* Write an interface `Calculator` with a method `add` that takes two integers as parameters. Write a method `tester` in a different class that receives a calculator as a parameter and check that `add(2, 3)` gives 5. Write a `SimpleCalculator` that uses the normal Java addition (“+”) to implement `Calculator`.
//interfaces with generics
* Implement a `Predicate<String>` to represent a function that associates to a String the value `true` iff its length is even.
* Define a class `Pair<T1, T2>` to store an ordered pair of objects of type `T1` and `T2`.
// implements but no inheritance
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c5/exercises.html[EE5.7] [M] (the part about anonymous classes is optional)
//** Supplementary requirements: your code must lie in at least two packages;
//** The idea of this exercice is that you simulate that three different people work on this exercice: one provides some interfaces; another implements the interfaces; a third one uses the interfaces and their implementations to solve the exercice (except you represent all these persons).
//** Declare at least one interface in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file);
//** implement those interfaces in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file) (will you need the previous JAR file? Why / why not?);
//** solve the exercices in a third Eclipse project (will you need the previous JAR files? Which ones and why?).
// read, sort a list
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c7/exercises.html[EE7.1], 7.5 (except that you can use built-sorting functions from the Java API).
* A class E1 that asks the end-user for a set of integer values. The user enters 0 to stop entering values. Store these values in a Set of Integer values (discarding duplicates). Do it again, obtaining a second set. Then print each set of values entered, then the union of both sets. For example, if the user enters 3, 4, 2, 0, then 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, it prints: 3, 4, 2, then 1, 2, 5, then 3, 4, 2, 1, 5. [M]
* Project: Contract [M]
