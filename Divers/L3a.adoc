The entry page of the course about Java in L3.

== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics and the basic (non object-oriented) programming concepts in Java. If you have followed an algorithmics course with illustrations and exercices in Java, you satisfy the prerequisites.

== Abbreviations

* [SK]: Supposedly Known
* [I]: Important
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* [M]: Mandatory exercices
* ESx.y(.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.

== Instructions & grading

=== Book exercices
* Create a personal repository named `Java-L3-Eck-Ex`. You deposit the book exercices (EE) there. All related classes must be prefixed with `EExx`, for example `EE34MyClass`.
* All mandatory (suffixed with [M]) book exercices (prefixed with EE) must be in that repository (in the branch `master`), 3 days before the lecture, 23:59 + 1min (e.g., lecture Saturday 23rd means a deadline on the end of Wednesday 20th).
* For the book exercices, you receive either 1 (exercices are done on time, even imperfectly, committed under your name) or 0 (exercices are not done on time). This counts for 10% of the CC grade. (Once graded, you can remove the book exercices from your repository, or leave them there.)

=== Project
* Create a group repository (once for the group).
* For each functionality: open a new Issue, named exactly according to the functionality. Do not rename the issue (only the original name counts).
* You will be graded for your project functionalities. Those grades count for the CC grade. You can modify the code afterwards for a better Project grade.

Don’t hesitate to send me your question by e-mail if you’re blocked in your project, instead of wasting hours. However, I do expect that you make some research before you ask, and that your question be clear. See these https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2012/11/24/stack-overflow-question-checklist/[guidelines].

=== General
* The final grade is a mix of 50% CC grade, 50% Project grade.
* Your GitHub username and git “User Name” must be identical.

== Take notes
* 5 ways of taking notes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AffuwyJZTQQ[video]
* http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/6/1159[Research] shows that taking notes, and especially writing what is said in your own words after some mental processing, permits more effective study

== Planning
// Object: 10 ; Project: 7
// TODO say: one or two persons per issue; not a better grade for a given issue if one, but better grades overall if fewer persons effectively working in a project

** Do _not_ send me an e-mail to give me your username, or your repository URL. I’ll find it out.
** You are not obliged to use the command `git` to send your files on GitHub for now, you may do it “manually” with your web browser. Here is how. (Or watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgzOiH1kmnI&t=1m20s[video], from 1min 20s to 4min.)
.. When creating your repository, check the box “Initialize this repository with a README” (the goal is simply to make your repository non-empty)
.. You can use the `Upload files` button or directly drag and drop your Java files on your resulting repository
.. Keep the default option: “Commit directly to the `master` branch”, click `Commit changes`.
* Indicate your GitHub username on https://mycourse.dauphine.fr/webapps/blackboard/execute/launcher?type=Course&id=_38274_1[MyCourse].

* EE5.3 [M]
** Supplementary requirement: you will archive `PairOfDice` and `StatCalc` into a JAR file and use this in a new Eclipse project where only one class is defined, which uses `PairOfDice` and `StatCalc`.
* Project: Contract [M]

* EE10.4 (except you use the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html[Predicate] interface from the Java API instead of writing your own)
// play bj
* EE5.5
// implements but no inheritance
* EE5.7 [M] (the part about anonymous classes is optional)
** Supplementary requirements: your code must lie in at least two packages;
** The idea of this exercice is that you simulate that three different people work on this exercice: one provides some interfaces; another implements the interfaces; a third one uses the interfaces and their implementations to solve the exercice (except you represent all these persons).
** Declare at least one interface in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file);
** implement those interfaces in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file) (will you need the previous JAR file? Why / why not?);
** solve the exercices in a third Eclipse project (will you need the previous JAR files? Which ones and why?).
