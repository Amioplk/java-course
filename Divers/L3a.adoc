The planning of the course.

== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics and the basic (non object-oriented) programming concepts in Java. If you have followed an algorithmics course with illustrations and exercices in Java, you satisfy the prerequisites.

== Abbreviations

* [SK]: Supposedly Known
* [I]: Important (some parts may be both SK and I)
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* [M]: Mandatory exercices
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.
* ESx.y(.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)

== Instructions & grading

* Create a personal repository named `Java-L3-Eck-Ex`. You deposit the book exercices (EE) there. All related classes must be prefixed with EExx, for example EE34MyClass.
* Create a group repository (once for the group). The exercices about the project go there.
* All mandatory exercices must be in the appropriate repository, merged in the branch `master`, 3 days before the lecture, 23:59 + 1min (e.g., lecture Saturday 23rd means a deadline on the end of Wednesday 20th).
* You will be graded for your project exercices. Those grades count for the CC grade. You can modify the code afterwards for a better Project grade.
* For the book exercices, you receive either 1 (exercice is done, even imperfectly, committed under your name) or 0 (exercice not done). This counts for 10% of the CC grade.
* The final grade is a mix of 50% CC grade, 50% Project grade.

** Packages, classes and directories.
* https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course/raw/master/Objets/presentation.pdf[Objects].
* Interfaces: design; use as type; replaceability.
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c5/[ES5] intro to 5.4
* ES5.3.4 [I]
* Améliorer pour des points (et du prestige)
** Correction acceptée : +1
** Correction impressionnante : +1 point de prestige
* Clean repository

Approximatively: 50p.

* You are expected to not use the default package, for all exercices from now on [M]
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c5/exercises.html[EE5]
* EE5.3 [M]
* EE5.7 [M] (the part about anonymous classes is optional)
** Supplementary requirements: your code must lie in at least two packages;
** The idea of this exercice is that you simulate that three different people work on this exercice: one provides some interfaces; another implements the interfaces; a third one uses the interfaces and their implementations to solve the exercice (except you represent all these persons).
** Declare at least one interface in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file);
** implement those interfaces in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file) (will you need the previous JAR file? Why / why not?);
** solve the exercices in a third Eclipse project (will you need the previous JAR files? Which ones and why?).
