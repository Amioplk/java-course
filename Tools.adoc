Various useful tools for Java and Java EE developers.

== Java

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java] 8 (or ulterior)
** Important advice. Uninstall every version of Java you have, keep only one: the latest JDK (which includes a JRE).
** On Debian: https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=openjdk-8-jdk&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all[openjdk-8-jdk] (install https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=openjdk-8-source&searchon=names&exact=1&suite=all&section=all[openjdk-8-source] to have the Javadoc accessible even when coding offline).
** On Windows: install the JDK (which itself comes with a private JRE). Do not install the public JRE (uncheck the box). Set the environment variables: JAVA_HOME to where you installed the JDK and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/install/installation-jdk-and-jre-microsoft-windows-platforms.htm#JSJIG-GUID-96EB3876-8C7A-4A25-9F3A-A2983FEC016A[PATH] to "%JAVA_HOME%\bin" (for details, see http://maven.apache.org/install.html[Maven] and http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_run_Eclipse%3F#Find_the_JVM[Eclipse], https://java.com/en/download/help/manual_regedit.xml[help] with removing traces of previous install). 
//** Note: some https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml[doc] indicates that setting the PATH is not necessary to run Java programs. However, http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_run_Eclipse%3F#Find_the_JVM[Eclipse] (for example) will apparently not start if it does not find Java in the path (unless specifically configured). Perhaps the https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/shell/app-registration[App Paths] mechanism could be used instead? (See also https://parsiya.net/blog/2017-10-23-run-line-vs.-cmd-vs.-powershell/[here].) Setting JAVA_HOME might be unnecessary, as under https://sources.debian.org/src/openjdk-8/8u181-b13-1/debian/JAVA_HOME/[Linux]. TODO: check whether .jar start; check whether Maven requires JAVA_HOME.
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven]

For Java SE, add:

* https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse IDE] “for Java Developers”

For Java EE, add:

* https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse IDE] “for Java EE Developers”
* http://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/photon/4.6.0.Final.html[JBoss Tools], a plug-in for easy deployment to Wildfly. Install only JBoss AS Wildfly, EAP & Server Tools (Rationale: I have had stability issues in Eclipse after installing the whole of JBoss Tools.)
* Start the wildfly server from Eclipse and browse to the home page. You should see the default Wildfly welcome page, which indicates that you have not yet added any users to be able to access the admin console. Follow the instructions to solve that problem.

== Git

* Git https://git-scm.com/downloads[client] (I recommend the command line for learning; I’ve been told https://www.gitkraken.com/[GitKraken] is a great GUI complement)
* https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup[Configure] your git identity: `user.name` and `user.email`. (Specific for GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-username-in-git/[user.name], https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/[user.email].)

== Command line
You should know how to execute command-line operations (thus, how to open a “terminal”). For Windows, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-windows-powershell[PowerShell].

== Eclipse
For Eclipse users, I strongly recommend reading the following, for a great increase to your productivity and pleasure of coding.

* Workbench User Guide, http://help.eclipse.org/photon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-02a.htm?cp=0_1_0_0[Basic tutorial]
* Workbench User Guide, http://help.eclipse.org/photon/topic/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tips/platform_tips.html?cp=0_5[Tips and Tricks]
* Java development user guide, http://help.eclipse.org/photon/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/gettingStarted/qs-2.htm[Basic tutorial]
* Java development user guide, http://help.eclipse.org/photon/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tips/jdt_tips.html?cp=1_5[Tips and Tricks] (JDT) (bit by bit!)

[[Eclipse-strict]]
=== Configuration
I recommend configuring Eclipse to show more errors and warnings in order to help spot mistakes and code smells early.

* From Eclipse, import my sample link:++Best practices/Eclipse-prefs.epf++[epf] (Eclipse preference) file. 
* You can read the file contents to see what this changes to your Eclipse configuration.
* Check in `Windows / Preferences` whether the changes were applied. For example, check in `Java / Code Style / Code Templates` that the `Catch block body` contains `throw new IllegalStateException(e);`.
* Check in your project properties, `Java Compiler / Errors/Warnings` that the project uses your global Eclipse compiler settings.
* Clean and recompile your project to see the effect.

== VM (beta)
https://universitedauphine-my.sharepoint.com/personal/olivier_cailloux_lamsade_dauphine_fr/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?docid=03887190377294e79a8a63c8f063ffe9b&authkey=AdV4WjBgnfjLa2IRffbav5s&e=10400376c63043138b324257b2c8c6a6[Here] is a Virtual Machine (VM) file that contains all the tools above. It features https://www.debian.org/doc/user-manuals[Debian] stretch (9.2), a GNU/Linux system. The VM file is in a standard format (OVA). You can import it in https://www.virtualbox.org/[Virtual Box] for example.

The file is in beta version, please report any issues https://github.com/oliviercailloux/Deb-9-VM[here].

Note that you will get (much) better performance by installing the tools directly on your machine rather than using them through a VM.
