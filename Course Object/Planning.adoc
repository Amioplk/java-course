The planning of the course.

== Prerequisites
You know algorithmics and the basic (non object-oriented) programming concepts in Java. If you have followed an algorithmics course with illustrations and exercices in Java, you satisfy the prerequisites.

== Abbreviations

* [SK]: Supposedly Known
* [I]: Important (some parts may be both SK and I)
* [O]: Optional (do it if you are specifically interested in the related aspect)
* [M]: Mandatory exercices
* Markers apply to the whole line. Example: "4.3 intro to 4.3.2, 4.6.1 [I]" means that everything in between 4.3 and 4.3.2 plus 4.6.1 are important.
* ESx.y(.z): designates section x.y (or x.y.z) in Eck’s http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/[book] (in chapter x)
* EQx.y: question number y in Eck’s book, from quiz chapter x
* EQx: quiz chapter x
* EEx.y: exercice number y in Eck’s book, from exercices chapter x
* Ranges are always given with ends included (EQ1.3 to 1.9 means 3 and 9 included)

== Advices

* Skim lightly over the [SK] parts, just to check whether you know it indeed. Do read the non-[SK] and non-[O] parts.
* Use the quiz as a test: read the text, _then_ check that you can answer the quiz.
* Don’t feel obliged to implement all exercices (especially the simple ones): try to estimate whether you’re able to solve the problem; do implement some of them to check whether you really can.

* (Use of Javadoc in Eclipse.)
* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c3/[ES3.7] (except 3.7.3), http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c4/[4 intro] to 4.7.

Approximatively: 48p. 

* You are expected to comment all your code appropriately with Javadoc, for all exercices from now on [M]

== S3

* Packages, classes and directories.

* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c5/[ES5] intro to 5.4
* ES5.3.4 [I]

Approximatively: 50p.

* http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/javanotes7/c5/exercises.html[EE5]
* EE5.3 [M]
* EE5.7 [M] (the part about anonymous classes is optional)
** Supplementary requirements: your code must lie in at least two packages;
** The idea of this exercice is that you simulate that three different people work on this exercice: one provides some interfaces; another implements the interfaces; a third one uses the interfaces and their implementations to solve the exercice (except you represent all these persons).
** Declare at least one interface in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file);
** implement those interfaces in another Eclipse project, exported as a Java archive (JAR file) (will you need the previous JAR file? Why / why not?);
** solve the exercices in a third Eclipse project (will you need the previous JAR files? Which ones and why?).
