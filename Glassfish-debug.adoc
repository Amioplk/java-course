= Debug under Glassfish

== Does Glassfish see my servlets?
When you can’t reach your servlet, check whether Glassfish sees it. (Tested under Glassfish 4.1.2.)

* Start your domain
* Run `asadmin`
* `list-applications` ⇒ check that your application appears, otherwise, it is most probably not deployed correctly
* `list-sub-components` <app-name> ⇒ check that your servlet appears.

If your application deploys but your servlet isn’t seen, you may have forgotten an annotation. Do check the server log, it probably contains useful information.

== Clear log
Run `asadmin rotate-log` to clear the log.
